# Authentication-React-Native
A Simple Login Sign Up React Native App using Node.js and SQLite.

To Run the App:
1) Dowload the Zip/Clone

2) Install Dependencies
  -> npm install -g expo-cli (To install Expo Client on desktop)
  -> npm install -g react-native-cli (To install React Native on desktop)
  -> npm install react-native-router-flux (For In-App Routing between pages)
  
3) Run the App 
  ->npm start OR expo client
  
4) After some time a QR Code will be displayed on the CLI (BE PATIENT), Scan that QR on Phone's Camera App

5) It will redirect to an app named 'EXPO', If you dont have it then download it from Appstore or Playstore.
